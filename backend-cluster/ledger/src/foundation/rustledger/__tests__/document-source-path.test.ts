/**
 * A Document's relative path names a file beside the source file that
 * declares it. The report used to copy the raw path, so `document … "receipt.txt"`
 * in `books/documents.bean` linked to a root `receipt.txt` that does not exist
 * (w4/301). The real-WASM parse and worker clone are covered by
 * `yarn verify:rustledger`; these cases pin the resolution and the provenance
 * round trip across a structured clone.
