 * Forced colors drops the box-shadow and maps both states' text and border
 * onto the same system colours, so the pressed filters looked exactly like
 * their unpressed neighbours — a reader could not see which filters had
 * emptied the journal. `aria-pressed` was always correct; only the visible
 * state was lost.
 *
 * A class-name assertion would not show that, so these cases compile the
 * classes the component actually applies and assert on the CSS Tailwind
 * emits. The rendered styling itself was measured in a real browser under
 * forced-colors emulation.
