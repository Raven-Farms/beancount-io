"""What `bea-engine append` answers: raw Beancount directive text, validated then written.

`bea ask` hands the model free-form ledger text rather than a typed `add`
request. Parsing, rejecting configuration directives, and the atomic append all
belong here so the AI process never loads Beancount (ADR014 t022).

A dry-run answers with a snapshot `token` the caller must pass back on the
commit call. That is how confirmation in the frontend still detects an edit
made while the user was deciding: the token freezes the include graph at
validate time, and the commit refuses if anything changed.
