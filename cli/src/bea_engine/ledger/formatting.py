"""Align ledger files the way `bean-format` does — locked, and one atomic replace.

Formatting used to happen in the frontend around `bean-format --in-place`: the
user's own file was handed to upstream, which truncates it and writes the
aligned text back, and then the frontend rewrote it a second time for the
canonical posting indent. Neither write was staged and neither took the ledger
lock, so an interrupt could leave the file empty (w3/435) and a concurrent
`bea add` that had already reported success could be silently discarded
(w3/434).

Upstream's alignment is a pure text transformation — `align_beancount` *is*
`bean-format`, which deliberately does not parse — so the engine runs it in
memory and reuses the discipline every other writer here already has: read and
align under `lock_file`, stage into a `candidate_file` beside the original,
`os.replace` it over the target. The file is read but never written until the
last step, so it never passes through zero bytes and never holds a half-applied
formatting pass.

The same comparison answers `bea format --check` / `--dry-run`, so the report
and the rewrite can never disagree about what would change.
