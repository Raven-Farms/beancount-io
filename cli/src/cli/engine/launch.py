"""Run engine programs as child processes.

Three shapes, because the boundary carries three kinds of traffic:

- `run_native` and `run_engine_argv` hand the caller's streams to the child and
  pass its exit status back untouched. Upstream keeps owning its stdout, its
  stderr and its status, an interactive program still sees the terminal, and a
  pipe still streams. `bea check`, `bea doctor`, `bea example`, `bea treeify`,
  and optional `bea price` (`bean-price`) are this shape.
- `run_optional_script` runs a user script (Beangulp ingest) with the engine
  interpreter after `require_feature`, still as a child process.
- `capture_native` keeps the child's output instead, for the few places where
  the frontend has to read the answer before it can act on it — `bea check
  --json` parses `bean-check --json`, and `bea format --check` compares the
  formatter's output against the file on disk.
- `helper_json` runs a helper command that answers with one JSON envelope,
  which the frontend renders itself.

Never `shell=True` and never a joined string: arguments go across as an argv
array, so a ledger path with spaces, quotes or a `$` in it needs no escaping
and cannot turn into shell syntax. Nothing here sets `cwd` either — the child
inherits the caller's working directory, so a relative path on the command line
means to the engine what it meant in the shell.

Resolving the engine, in order:

1. `$BEA_ENGINE_PYTHON` — an interpreter named outright.
2. A provisioned engine that is already installed. When a checkout's `cli/src`
   is also present, that source is put on `PYTHONPATH` so the helper module
   under edit wins over whatever the provisioned venv last installed — still
   the same Beancount interpreter, still a child process.
3. A checkout's `cli/src`, run with this interpreter. Still a separate process,
   and the only concession to the transition: it lets a developer exercise the
   boundary without provisioning, and it is unavailable from an installed
   wheel, whose helper resources are nested under `cli/_runtime`.
4. Provisioning a new engine.

`resolve_engine` answers that order without provisioning, and `bea engine
status` reports its answer, so what status names is what a command would run.

`native_command` resolves upstream executables in that same order, so a
developer's `bea format` runs the `bean-format` beside the interpreter they are
working with and a customer's runs the provisioned one. Neither consults
`PATH`: a globally installed Beancount of some other version must never answer.
Optional features (`beangulp`, `beanprice`) must be enabled first; see
`require_feature` / `run_optional_native` / `run_optional_script`.
