"""`bea query` — BQL in the engine process (ADR014 t005).

Every mode is a child process. A query string runs through the helper's `query`
command, which dispatches it the way `bean-query` does — so `PRINT` prints
directives instead of a `ROW(*)` table — and answers with either upstream's own
rendering or the rows themselves. No query string opens the helper's `shell`
command with the streams inherited, which is upstream's interactive shell on
the customer's terminal.

The frontend keeps what it has always owned: which ledger, whether a read that
found load errors may answer anyway (`--allow-errors`, `--strict`), and the
JSON envelope. It keeps none of the accounting: there is no connection, no
result rendering and no `BQLShell` subclass here any more.
