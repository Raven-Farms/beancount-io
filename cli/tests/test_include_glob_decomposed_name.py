"""An include glob spelled in decomposed (NFD) text finds its NFD files (w5/202).

Ledger text is read as NFC so account names merge, and that once reached the
include pattern too: `include "été-*.bean"` written decomposed was globbed in
composed form, wildcard matching compares directory entries code point for
code point, and every loading command failed with "File glob ... does not
match any files" on a ledger stock `bean-check` accepts. Decomposed names are
what older macOS volumes, unzip and rsync from macOS leave behind.
