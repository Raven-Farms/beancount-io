"""A refused write looks for an including root once, not once per error (w5/112).

Every unknown-account error in the candidate asked `including_root` again, and
each ask lexes the include closure of every ledger beside the invoked file. A
ledger with thousands of transactions on one unopened account therefore
stalled every `bea add` for minutes before refusing it.
