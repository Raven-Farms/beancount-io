"""`add transactions --partial` bisects for rows an existing assertion refuses (w5/537).

w5/123 made `--partial` drop the rows a refused batch's errors name, but an
existing balance assertion the batch breaks is reported on the ledger's own
line: no row can be named, and recovery fell back to one full load per row
over a growing batch — 34 seconds for 800 rows. The first refused row is now
found by bisection, so one bad row costs a load per halving.
