# w23 — Worker queue (worker1)

**Worker:** worker1 — general-purpose adoption worker; accepts the next highest-impact milestone across packages, topics, and A1/A2/A3 rather than owning a permanent specialty.

## Milestones

## Dropped

- ~~**046**~~ — social follower/following/starred lists answer an unknown user with an empty success — dropped 2026-10-21: documented behavior (`backend-cluster/backend-v2/docs/mcp.md`, social reads: "returns an empty page on upstream failure, so an empty result does not establish that the user has no followers or stars")

## Inbox

- [065](./065.md) — a ledger-pinned credential keeps the old name after a rename: its own `listLedgers` shows the new name, which the pin refuses; owner picks repository-ID pins, canonical-name pins, or an accurate refusal (split from 061)
- [064](./064.md) — `createLedger`/`updateLedger` accept names the schema allows but the service rewrites (`x-` → `x`, `a--b` → `a-b`): the next call by the sent name is `NOT_FOUND`
- [059](./blocked/059.md) — every product-created ledger ships `auto_accounts`, so a misspelt account is silently opened — **blocked:** owner picks drop-plugin (which also limits AI categorization to existing accounts) vs report-new-accounts
- [022](./blocked/022.md) — report rustledger BQL gaps upstream (`cost(sum(position))`, `neg`/`filter_currency`, `meta('lineno')`, `AT value`, `BALANCES FROM`) — **blocked:** filing in an external tracker needs the user's approval
- [026](./blocked/026.md) — streaming archive route for MCP OAuth clients over 8 MiB (option 1 from 023) — **blocked:** an ADR 0007 trust-boundary decision for the owner
