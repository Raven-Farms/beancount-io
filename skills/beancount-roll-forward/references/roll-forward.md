# Roll-forward calculation — tested against beanquery (beancount v3)

All queries below are verified. Run them with `bea --file "$ledger" --json --no-input query "$query"`; the shared command contract is in beancount-init's `references/bea-cli.md`. Adjust the placeholders (`<account>`, `<start>`, `<end>`) to the resolved account and half-open period (`<end>` is the first day after the period).

## The identity

For one account and one currency over `[<start>, <end>)`:

```
closing = opening + sum(signed movements)
```

- **Opening** is every posting to the account before `<start>` — including opening-balance entries. Nothing is special-cased.
- **Movements** are the signed postings inside the period, listed individually so each can be named by its counterparty, payee, or narration.
- **Closing** is every posting before `<end>`, computed independently — never as opening plus movements. The explanation is only valid when the two routes to closing agree exactly; any difference is reported, never plugged.
- **Cost basis by default.** Balances use `cost(position)`, so an inventory lot counts at what was paid. Market value is separate and labelled with its valuation date and price. A missing period-end price is a named gap, not a zero. If the user also asks what the holdings are worth and a later price is available, show that later valuation separately, preserving the period-end gap; never present a later price as historical period-end value.
- **One currency at a time.** A query that mixes currencies returns mixed-unit rows; run the trio per currency and never add across currencies. Commodity units (shares) roll forward in units, separately from their cost.
- **Uncategorized is a visible bucket.** A movement whose counterparty cannot be named from the entry stays listed under `Uncategorized` with its date and amount. It is never dropped, netted away, or forced into a category to make the table tidy — an unexplained movement is the finding, not noise.
- **Negative and credit balances keep their signs.** A liability closing at −4,600.00 means 4,600.00 owed; state the direction in words instead of flipping signs silently.

## 1. Opening balance

<!-- recipe: rollforward-opening -->
```sql
SELECT sum(cost(position)) AS bal WHERE account = '<account>' AND date < <start>
```

## 2. Signed movements, one row each

<!-- recipe: rollforward-movements -->
```sql
SELECT date, payee, narration, cost(position) AS movement WHERE account = '<account>' AND date >= <start> AND date < <end> ORDER BY date
```

Name each row's bucket from the entry's other postings (the account(s) on the opposite side), falling back to payee, then narration; rows that resist all three are `Uncategorized`.

## 3. Closing balance (independent)

<!-- recipe: rollforward-closing -->
```sql
SELECT sum(cost(position)) AS bal WHERE account = '<account>' AND date < <end>
```

## 4. Market value (state the price date)

This query uses the ledger's latest available prices for the selected holdings; the posting-date filter does **not** bound the price date. Inspect the ledger's price directives and label the result with the actual valuation date and price. For the eval fixture, January closes with 10 ACME at 1,000.00 USD cost. The available 2026-02-01 price of 110.00 USD values those holdings at 1,100.00 USD on that date; January 31 market value remains unavailable.

<!-- recipe: rollforward-value -->
```sql
SELECT sum(value(position)) AS bal WHERE account = '<account>' AND date < <end>
```

## Worked tie-out (the eval fixture)

`Assets:PrepaidInsurance`, January 2026: opening 1,200.00; movements +600.00 premium top-up, −150.00 recognition; closing 1,650.00 — both routes agree. `Liabilities:Loan`: opening −5,000.00; movement +400.00 principal; closing −4,600.00 owed. `Assets:BrokerCash`: opening 2,000.00; movements −1,000.00 purchase, +25.00 dividend; closing 1,025.00.
